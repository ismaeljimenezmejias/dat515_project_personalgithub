## Questions and Topics for Discussion (Before Meeting)

Prepare 3-5 questions and topics you want to discuss with your mentor.

1. Are my following steps okey?

Cloud deployment
Status: Open.
#11 

First, should I deploy the database in postgresql (or whatever cloud platform) for exmample? and after that it's better to deploy the app with kubernetes with openstack? and when that's working should I deploy it in the google platform which i have credits insted of openstack? Is that a good understanding?
Also, I don't know since I haven't tried it when I'm about to deploy it, if it will ask me which node will use as talos worker, as openstack did? Then it will be using the postgresql with de backend being controlled by some google cloud talos node?
